### Hi there 👋
I'm Tobias aka Biteworks. I am developing web apps, websites and simple desktop apps in my spare time.
Technologies I am currently using are 
* PHP
* JS (VanillaJS, React and VueSJ)
* C#/WPF
* Python

I have a design background and work during the day in 3D visualization. Clear design and usability are important for me. Technology should not be a barrier and should not be used as an end in itself. I see technology as a tool and not as a savior.
