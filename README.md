## Hi there üëã

### About
I'm Tobias aka Biteworks. I am developing web apps, websites and simple desktop apps in my spare time.  
I ‚ù§Ô∏è design, good UX and new technologies. I am curious and like to learn new things.

**Technologies I am currently using are**
* PHP
* JS (VanillaJS, React and VueSJ)
* Python (mostly to automate or in Blender)
* Processing (Java)
* C#/WPF
* Bash

I have a design background and work during the day in 3D visualization. Clear design and usability are important for me. Technology should not be a barrier and should not be used as an end in itself.

### "Manifest" (kinda)
I believe that open source software offers great possibilities and therefore I make many of my projects open source. 

Sharing knowledge moves everyone forward. This applies both in private and in professional life. I am convinced that there is no disadvantage in sharing what I have learned, because I also reflect on what I know.

### Update
Brand new I started with [Blender](https://blender.org) addon development and I'm looking forward to make my everyday life easier and learn new things with it.
